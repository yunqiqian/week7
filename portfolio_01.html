        <h3>01 SOCIAL CONTEXT</h3>
        <h4>WHAT HAVE I OBSERVED</h4>
        <h5>Large Audience</h5>
        <p>For this project, I’m focusing on coffee drinkers, to be more specific, people who consume caffeine frequently on a daily basis. Considering coffee culture being a mainstream nowadays, this project will work to provide service for a large community.</p>
        <h5>Lake of Guidance</h5>
        <p>One common problem shared among the coffee drinkers is that they keep track of their caffeine intake by counting the cups of coffee they consume daily instead of the actual number of caffeine intake. This results in flaw calculation because depending on the types of coffee, the amount of caffeine various distinctly. </p>
        <h5>Overconsumption Is Easy</h5>
        <p>Overconsumption of caffeine is fairly easy to achieve than most people think. Although how much caffeine a person can consume on a healthy level depends on the age, weight, etc., for average, 400mg caffeine is the limit for most healthy adults, that’s two cups of Starbucks’ grande americano.</p>
        <h5>Consequence Is Severe</h5>
        <p>The side effects relating to overconsumption of caffeine can various from sleepless to heart attack, depending on people’s physical sensitivity to caffeine.</p>

        <h3>02 DESIGN PROBLEM</h3>
        <p>Users who frequently consume caffeine need to have guidance on how to control the amount of consumption because overconsumption can easily make people experience levels of body discomfort or even endangered their lives.</p>

        <h3>04 DESIGN PHILOSOPHY</h3>
        <h4>MY ROLE AS A DESIGNER</h4>
        <p>My role as a designer is to think on the user’s end as much as possible. My design philosophy is to discover what the user needs, what they don’t need and satisfy the need to the user’s ease, getting rid of the ones that hinder the user flow. I went through the user’s daily routine and find out the easiest way to fit this habit into their life. I take responsibility to organize a robust database so that the user won’t need to take extra steps. I do think keeping track of the caffeine consumption is a crucial habit to have. In order to encourage the user to take good care of their body, we, as designers need to take the first step. By implementing the daily education feature into the app, I also intend to advocate the coffee vendors to take part in this process as well. The coffee vendors are already labeling their drinks with the number of calories. The amount of caffeine is no less important than calories in the effects to human bodies. </p>
